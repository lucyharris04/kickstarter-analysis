# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
 Analizing data from fund raising projects to help Louise insure her fundraising goals for her play are met in time for production. 

### Purpose
- The purpose of this analysis is to vizualize the campaign outcomes based on their launch date and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges
I was able to form the data from the Kickstater spreedsheet to show the outcomes of fund raisers based on their launch data and goals using coding within Excel as well as tables to help visualize the filter data. The unfamiliar formalas such as the COUNTIFS formula were chalenging for me as I had never used them before. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I found that going behind my work with either a calulation or the CTRL+F fumction on my keyboard proved to be helpful as well as the error messages within Excel. These error messages showed me exactly were I was going wrong and even provided me possible solutions to my syntax errors. 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The campaigns with the most success were started between April and July with the highest rate of success occuring in May. The campaigns with the highest fail rate were launched in October. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Campaigns with goals between $25,000 to $30,000 and $45,000 to $50,000 or more had the highest chance of success. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
There were no canceled fundraising campaigns organized for plays which limited the data set availibily. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Another table one might consider creating would be a comparison between the years that the campaigns were launched and their rate of success.
